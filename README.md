Advent of Code 2021
===================

These are my solutions to the puzzles in the 2021 session of 
Advent of Code. They're not always the _best_ solutions, but they get the right answers. (Well, see the notes, below.)

In previous years, I've skipped any days that weren't fun. Sometimes, that was a problem where a straightforward approach
was fine for part one, but insufficient for part 2. Or maybe the solution was just going to take more work than I
wanted to put into it. That means my personal best is 40 stars out of 50, which is still pretty respectable.

But, this year, I got solutions for the first 18 days, with only minimal need for hints. So, I'm really hoping to get
all the way through it.

Notes
-----

* Day 12, part 2: This one works, but it takes a long time -- approximately 15 minutes on a moderately fast computer.
  I didn't worry about optimizing it any further, because that's not an awful amount of time to wait.

* Day 19: I have a plan for solving this one, but I ran out of time that day. I'm hoping to come back and finish this.

* Day 22: This is the first one that isn't fully my work. I was able to see the way to go about solving this, by keeping
  a collection of disjoint cubes that were all lit, and splitting them up when they intersected the new cubes. But, I
  couldn't wrap my head around the splitting. So, I took someone else's Python solution from the Reddit thread, and 
  adapted it into my code. So, the part-two star for this day is really more of an asterisk.

* Day 24: I implemented the brute-force approach, and as I should have expected, that's not going to work. Finding
  the solution requires reverse-engineering the MONAD program, and frankly, that's not my idea of fun. If this is
  the only day keeping me from getting all 50 stars, I may just cheat, and re-implement someone else's solution. If
  I solve 47 out of 50 puzzles on my own (and one of those three I got to mostly on my own) I'm still OK with it. It's
  not like there's anything but my own pride riding on this, and since I already blew past my previous best, I'm plenty
  proud, already.
